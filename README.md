# inverterAPI
inverterAPI is a simple, self-hosted api for serving data for ESP8266 or other IoT things.
The main motivation was to save electricity bill (whether running a washing machine will be cost-effective)
 ## Functions:
 -  Scraps data from the inverter,
 -  Use [elicznik](https://github.com/mlesniew/elicznik) for data scraping from tauron (this data is cached),
 -  And it continues to grow...
